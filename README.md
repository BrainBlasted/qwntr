# QWNTR

Search [qwant.com](https://qwant.com) from your terminal.

This is meant to be an alternative to apps like
[ddgr](https://github.com/jarun/ddgr) and
[googler](https://github.com/jarun/googler)
using the Qwant search engine and [api.qwant.com](https://api.qwant.com).

# Why?

Qwant prides itself as another privacy-based search engine.
Since there is an API available, I decided to make a
wrapper around it ([qwant-api](https://github.com/BrainBlasted/qwant-api))
and a client using that wrapper as an excercise while I learned
Rust.
